              The theme "never visit uninvited" any one’s place even if your
              father’s or the most loved one’s. There is some sense in this
              saying. we find such instances in our ancient religious texts.
              Here in support of this dictum. The shrimad bhagvata mahapuranam
              describes a story of goddess parvati and her consort lord Shiva.
              Ma (mother) giriraj kishori was an incarnation of Sati. Sati was
              the daughter of daksh prajapati who was the son of lord brahma.
              brahma is the originator of this universe. The trinity brahma,
              vishnu and Mahesh (Shiva) are responsible for the origin,
              governance and destruction of this universe. Sati was dear beloved
              to lord Mahesh and always wished to have lord mahes as her
              consort. With great penance she was granted her wish to get
              married to lord Mahesh in the present brith. But duksh prajapati
              was not happy and he developed animosity with lord Mahesh.

              Once daksh prajapati organised The theme "never visit uninvited"

              There is some sense in this saying. we find such instances in our

              animosity with lord Mahesh.
            </p>
            <p class="page-section-text">
              Once daksh prajapati organised a yagna at his place and invited other gods and
              their spouses but did not extend invitation to lord Mahesh and Sati although the
              letter happened to be his son-in-law and daughter respectively. Sati however got
              the news of this event from others. she prayed the lord Shiva to permit her to
              attend the event but the lord refused by saying "one should never visit anyone
              uninvited". Despite that Sati visited her father's place and she was not
              welcomed by anyone in the family. Enraged by this attitude she jumped in the
              fireplace (hawan kundi) and lost her life.
            </p>
            <p class="page-section-text">
              The sad news came to lord Shiva. He also became very angry and created
              veerbhadra who went to the place of daksh prajapati and killed him.
            </p>
            <p class="page-section-text">
              What lesson we get from this is that we should never visit any place uninvited.
              This is available in chapters 1-5 of skanda 4 of Shrimad bhagvata mahapuranam.
            </p>
            <p class="page-section-text">
              In the present scenario we should make it a point that we don't visit any place
              uninvited and more so become very choosy in visiting any place even with
              extensive warm invitation to prevent the spread of Covid-19. This is more true
              in the case of children who are innocent but they should be prevented and should
              be advised to follow this dictum.
