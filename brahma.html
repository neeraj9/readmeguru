                  Lord Brahma originated in this universe as self born
                  (swayambhu). It is believed that Lord Vishnu himself
                  entered as the inner controller that lotus representing
                  all the worlds which brought to light all the objects
                  of sensuous enjoyment. There appeared from it the
                  creator Brahma. It is so because the progenitor
                  of Brahma was not to be seen.

              It was a matter of time before Muni Shiromani Naradji, who is the son of
              Bhramaji, was immersed in penance. There was a cave in the Himalayan parbat near
              which the Devnadi Ganga flowed, where there was a diwasharam, usmine u asana
              tied and romantically immersed in the samadhi. When Devraj Indra heard about
              this, he realized that he did not want to take my kingdom, so Cupid was sent
              to him but he could not distract him.

              But Maya is a siren, once she fails, another form changes. He also distracted
              such a great gnani. Narada was also fascinated by a beautiful woman and wished
              Lord Vishnu a beautiful look for her.
            </p>
            <p class="page-section-text">
              But Lord Vishnu gave Naradaji the mouth of the monkey and adopted the lower
              body. Naradji was deeply saddened when he went to the Swayamwar sabha. Today's
              young men and women are also trapped in the trap of this maya. Even after having
              knowledge, the ignorant behave a bit. They are being drawn to what is not our
              culture.

              Your human values are stuttering. A legacy that Human has inherited after great
              penance is destroyed. The world is coming towards us and we are moving towards
              them. Not everything shining can be gold.
