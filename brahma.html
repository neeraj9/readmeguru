              The theme "never visit uninvited" any one’s place even if your father’s or the
              Most loved one’s. There is some sense in this saying. we find such instances in
              Our ancient religious texts. Here in support of this dictum. The Shrimadbhagvata
              mahapuranam describes a story of goddess Parvati and her consort Lord
              Shiva. Ma (mother) Giriraj Kishori was an incarnation of Sati. Sati was the
              Daughter of Dakshprajapati who was the son of Lord Brahma. Brahma is the
              Originator of this universe. The trinity Brahma, Vishnu and Mahesh (Shiva) are
              Responsible for the origin, governance and destruction of this universe. Sati
              Was dear beloved to Lord Mahesh and always wished to have Lord Mahesh as her
              Consort. With great penance she was granted her wish to get married to Lord
              Mahesh in the present birth. But Dakshprajapati was not happy and he developed
              Animosity with Lord Mahesh.
            </p>
            <p class="page-section-text">
              Once Dakshprajapati organised a yagna at his place and invited other gods and
              Their spouses but did not extend invitation to Lord Mahesh and Sati although the
              Latter happened to be his son-in-law and daughter respectively. Sati however got
              The news of this event from others. she prayed the Lord Shiva to permit her to
              Attend the event but the Lord refused by saying "one should never visit anyone
              Uninvited". Despite that Sati visited her father's place and she was not
              Welcomed by anyone in the family. Enraged by this attitude she jumped in the
              Fireplace (hawan kundi) and lost her life.
            </p>
            <p class="page-section-text">
              The sad news came to Lord Shiva. He also became very angry and created
              Veerbhadra who went to the place of Dakshprajapati and killed him.
            </p>
            <p class="page-section-text">
              What lesson we get from this is that we should never visit any place uninvited.
              This is described in Chapters 1-5 of Skanda 4 of Shrimadbhagvata mahapuranam.
            </p>
            <p class="page-section-text">
              In the present scenario we should make it a point that we don't visit any place
              Uninvited and more so become very choosy in visiting any place even with
              Extensive warm invitation to prevent the spread of Covid-19. This is more true
              In the case of children who are innocent but they should be prevented to visit
              any house and should be advised to follow this dictum.
