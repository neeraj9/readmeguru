Don't be confused with Illusion

It was a matter of time before Muni Shiromani Naradji, who is the son of
Bhramaji, was immersed in penance. There was a cave in the Himalayan parbat near
which the Devnadi Ganga flowed, where there was a diwasharam, usmine u asana
tied and romantically immersed in the samadhi. When Devraj Indra heard about
this, he realized that he did not want to take my kingdom, so Cupid was sent
to him but he could not distract him.

But Maya is a siren, once she fails, another form changes. He also distracted
such a great gnani. Narada was also fascinated by a beautiful woman and wished
Lord Vishnu a beautiful look for her.

But Lord Vishnu gave Naradaji the mouth of the monkey and adopted the lower
body. Naradji was deeply saddened when he went to the Swayamwar sabha. Today's
young men and women are also trapped in the trap of this maya. Even after having
knowledge, the ignorant behave a bit. They are being drawn to what is not our
culture.

Your human values are stuttering. A legacy that Human has inherited after great
penance is destroyed. The world is coming towards us and we are moving towards
them. Not everything shining can be gold.
