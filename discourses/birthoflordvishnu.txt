Birth of Lord Vishu

At one point of time, in the value of Shiva and Shiva, raman ain't doing raman,
it should be the creation of another man of Icha Ui, on whom they should take
the burden of conducting this creation and make it easier to divert it only in
Kashi.

By doing this, Shiva smeared nectar on the dasve part of the left. The man who
appeared from him was the most beautiful of the U Teno folk. They were the ocean
of the great ocean and they were full of many other qualities.

Shiva, being wide, named him Vishnu. Apart from that they gave more names. Shiva
imparted vedo knowledge to Shri Vishnu through the path of breathing and became
blessed with Shiva himself.

Vishnu put in a lot of water from his limbs with the same hard work of long-term
penance. They were the destroyers of all sins by touching the water. He was also
named Narayan by sleeping in the water.

Parents also give birth to bachun in this world at the right time, which later
moves on to this world. Just as God is happy to see is creation, so does man, he
is happy to see his children progress ing further.

He learns sanskar, gives him the knowledge of nurturing. Teaches you the lesson
of keeping creation beautiful. Just as vishnu's form attracts everyone to
himself, so the goonda form gives to his children.
